<p>The NASDAQ Composite Index (IXIC) is a broad market index that includes more than 3,000 common equities listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange, covering a wide range of industries but with a strong emphasis on technology and growth-oriented companies. Established in 1971, the index serves as a key benchmark for U.S. equities, especially in the tech sector.</p>

<p>Unlike price-weighted indices, the NASDAQ Composite is weighted by market capitalization, meaning companies with higher market value have a greater influence on the index's movements. It includes many large multinational corporations, such as Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), and Tesla, reflecting the overall health of the technology and innovation-driven economy.</p>

<p>The index encompasses various sectors beyond technology, including consumer services, health care, financials, and industrials. Its heavy weighting towards high-growth and speculative stocks means it can be more volatile than other broad indices like the S&P 500.</p>

<p>NASDAQ Composite is widely followed by investors and analysts for insight into market trends, particularly in technology and biotechnology fields. Its performance is tracked by numerous ETFs and mutual funds, making it an essential indicator of U.S. stock market dynamics.</p>
