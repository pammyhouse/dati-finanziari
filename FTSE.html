<p>The FTSE 100 Index (FTSE), also known as the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index or "Footsie", represents the 100 largest companies listed on the London Stock Exchange by market capitalization. It is a key indicator of the performance of major UK companies and the broader British economy. The index includes prominent names from sectors such as energy, finance, consumer goods, and healthcare — including firms like HSBC, BP, GlaxoSmithKline, and Unilever. Calculated in real time, the FTSE 100 is widely used by investors around the world as a benchmark for UK equity performance. It is capitalization-weighted and updated every 15 seconds during trading hours. Movements in the index often reflect investor sentiment around the UK’s economic outlook, interest rates, and geopolitical developments.</p>
