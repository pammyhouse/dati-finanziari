    <p>Natural gas is a key energy commodity traded on major exchanges such as the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). It is a fossil fuel used primarily for heating, electricity generation, and industrial applications. Natural gas futures are widely used by energy producers, utilities, and investors to hedge against price volatility and speculate on energy markets.
    The price of natural gas is influenced by several factors, including seasonal weather patterns, storage levels, production rates (especially from shale gas fields), geopolitical tensions, and changes in energy policy. Supply and demand fundamentals, export dynamics (LNG), and currency exchange rates also contribute to price movements.
    As an asset, natural gas offers opportunities for hedging and portfolio diversification, particularly for those seeking exposure to the energy sector.</p>
