<p>Crude oil is a key energy commodity and one of the most actively traded financial assets in global markets. It serves as the primary raw material for producing gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and petrochemicals, making it essential to the global economy. Crude oil is traded on major exchanges, including the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), primarily through futures contracts.
The price of crude oil is influenced by a range of factors, including geopolitical events, supply and demand dynamics, OPEC production decisions, U.S. shale output, and global economic conditions. Additionally, factors such as refinery capacity, natural disasters, and currency fluctuations impact price volatility.
