<p>The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as the "fear gauge," measures market expectations of near-term volatility conveyed by S&P 500 index option prices. Managed by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the VIX is widely used by investors to assess market sentiment and risk. A higher VIX value typically indicates increased investor fear or uncertainty, while a lower value suggests market stability and confidence. It plays a key role in risk management, derivatives trading, and hedging strategies, and is often used in conjunction with other indices to gain insight into overall market conditions.</p>
