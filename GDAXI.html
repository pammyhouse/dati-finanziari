<p>The DAX Performance Index (GDAXI), commonly known as the DAX 40, is Germany's leading stock market index, comprising the 40 largest and most liquid companies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. These companies span a wide range of sectors including automotive, chemicals, financial services, pharmaceuticals, and industrials. The index is capitalization-weighted and performance-based, meaning it includes dividends in its calculation, making it distinct from price-only indices. It serves as a primary benchmark for the German economy and is widely used by investors and analysts to assess the health of Germany’s corporate sector and broader economic trends. Major constituents include Siemens, SAP, Volkswagen, and Allianz. The DAX is calculated by Deutsche Börse and reflects real-time trading prices throughout the day.</p>
