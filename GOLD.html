<p>GOLD represents the exchange rate between one troy ounce of gold (XAU) and the United States Dollar (USD). It is a widely used financial instrument in the commodities market to express the price of gold in dollar terms. Gold is traditionally viewed as a safe-haven asset, sought after during periods of economic uncertainty, inflation, and geopolitical tension. It is used by central banks as a store of value and forms a key component in diversified investment portfolios. The gold market is global and highly liquid, with trading occurring via exchanges, over-the-counter (OTC) markets, and through derivative products such as futures and ETFs. The XAUUSD quote is closely followed by traders, institutional investors, and policymakers as an indicator of market sentiment and macroeconomic stability.</p>
