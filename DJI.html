<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) is a long-standing price-weighted index that tracks the performance of 30 large and established “blue‑chip” companies listed in the United States. It was originally created in 1896 by Charles Dow and Edward Jones to serve as a simple, real-time indicator of U.S. stock market trends. Unlike market-capitalization-weighted indices, the DJI gives greater weight to higher-priced stocks using a proprietary divisor to adjust for corporate actions like splits.  [oai_citation:0‡Wikipedia](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones?utm_source=chatgpt.com)</p>

<p>Due to its price-weighted structure, changes in higher-priced stocks—such as Goldman Sachs, Microsoft, Caterpillar, and Home Depot—disproportionately impact the index. As of mid-2025, the top contributors by weight include Goldman Sachs (~9.7%), Microsoft (~6.9%), Caterpillar (~5.6%), Home Depot (~5.1%), and Visa (~4.8%). The top five stocks alone account for over 32% of the index’s weight. ()</p>

<p>The DJI excludes transportation and utilities sectors, focusing instead on industrial, technology, healthcare, financial services, consumer goods, and other industries. The component list is periodically reviewed and updated when firms are acquired or no longer meet criteria—Amazon replaced Walgreens in 2025, reflecting evolving market trends. ()</p>

<p>The Dow is popularly referenced in media and used as an economic barometer, especially for legacy investors. However, it can diverge sharply from broader indices like the S&P 500 because it underrepresents mega-cap tech stocks such as Meta and Tesla. Such disparities have raised criticism of its outdated methodology. ()</p>

<p>Despite this, the DJI remains widely traded through ETFs like the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA), futures, options, and index-linked funds. It provides a snapshot of U.S. economic sentiment and remains influential in investor decision-making. ()</p>
