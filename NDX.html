<p>The Nasdaq-100 (NDX) is a stock market index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. Created in 1985, it is a modified market capitalization-weighted index, designed to reduce concentration risk by limiting the weight of the largest components. The index is composed primarily of technology companies but also includes firms from consumer services, healthcare, industrials, and telecommunications.</p>

<p>Key constituents of the Nasdaq-100 include global giants such as Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms (Facebook), Tesla, and Broadcom. While it excludes financial companies like banks and insurance firms, it provides a broad view of the performance of growth-oriented and innovative firms in the U.S. market. Technology alone typically represents over 60% of the index’s weight.</p>

<p>The index is reviewed quarterly to reflect changes in market capitalization and is rebalanced annually. In some cases, a special rebalancing occurs to mitigate overconcentration—such as the July 2023 rebalance that reduced the influence of mega-cap tech stocks like Apple and Microsoft. The Nasdaq-100 is widely tracked by ETFs such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and QQQM, and is one of the most traded indices globally.</p>

<p>Due to its high exposure to the tech sector, the NDX often experiences greater volatility compared to broader indices like the S&P 500, but it has also delivered strong long-term returns. It is a popular benchmark for investors looking to gain exposure to innovation-driven sectors of the economy, and it plays a central role in both passive and active investment strategies.</p>
