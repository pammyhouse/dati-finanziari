<p>The Russell 2000 Index (RUS2000) is a small-cap stock market index that comprises approximately 2,000 of the smallest companies in the Russell 3000 Index, representing a critical benchmark for the performance of smaller U.S. businesses. Covering a diverse range of industries such as healthcare, technology, consumer goods, and financial services, the index is widely used by investors to gauge the health of the U.S. domestic economy and to gain exposure to high-growth, emerging companies.
